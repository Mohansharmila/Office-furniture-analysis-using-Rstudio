# Office-furniture-analysis-using-Rstudio
In this two cluster approaches are used: hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering. It is unsupervised learning technique for grouping related data points which shows same behaviour in the dataset regardless of the outcome.
Office Data Marketing Analytics

Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive marketing analytics analysis on office data. It combines R programming and various statistical techniques to analyze office-based marketing metrics, identify trends, and support decision-making. The main objective is to gain actionable insights into marketing performance, customer segmentation, and revenue growth using data-driven approaches.

Files Included

	1.	office dataset.csv: This CSV file contains the raw data, capturing office-related metrics such as customer interactions, revenue figures, and product information. The data serves as the foundation for performing statistical analyses and deriving insights.
	2.	office codes.Rmd: This R Markdown file includes the code used to analyze the dataset. It covers data cleaning, visualization, statistical modeling, and summarization of findings. The document is structured to support reproducibility, with code blocks and detailed annotations.
	3.	office.html: This is the rendered HTML report generated from the office codes.Rmd file. It visually presents the analysis results, including charts, tables, and text explanations of each step, making it suitable for sharing insights with stakeholders.
	4.	README.md: This Markdown file serves as an introduction and guide to the project. It provides context for the data, the objectives of the analysis, and a summary of the results.

Key Features

	•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepares the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and transforming data for compatibility with various analyses.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand data distributions, identify patterns, and pinpoint key performance indicators (KPIs).
	•	Statistical Modeling: Applies regression and clustering techniques to predict outcomes and group customers, helping tailor marketing strategies.
	•	Insights and Recommendations: Summarizes findings and offers actionable recommendations based on data analysis, aimed at improving marketing performance and customer satisfaction.

Usage

To replicate this analysis:

	1.	Download the dataset (office dataset.csv).
	2.	Run the R Markdown file (office codes.Rmd) to perform the analysis.
	3.	View the output report (office.html) for a comprehensive presentation of results.

Requirements

	•	R programming language
	•	Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, readr, and any other relevant statistical or visualization packages used in office codes.Rmd

Future Enhancements

	•	Advanced Modeling: Expand the analysis by incorporating machine learning models to predict customer behaviors more accurately.
	•	Automation: Implement an automated pipeline for data updates, analysis, and report generation.
